# Create an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} topic
{: #en-create-en-topic}

{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} **topic** is based on a publish and subscription model. You can send notifications/alerts to multiple destination types, (email, SMS, and others) that are subscribed to a particular topic. Configure topics as needed and {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} handles the routing and delivering of alerts reliably to the right destinations.
{: shortdesc}

- Each topic is created under a registered source.
- Each topic can have its own set of rules, which routes the incoming payload to the respective topic.


## In the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} console, click **topics**.
{: #en-create-topic}
{: step}

{: step}

- Description; add a description for the topic (optional).
- Source; select a source from the dropdown list.

## Add rules to your topic
{: #en-topic-rules  }

{: note}

- Event sub type; select event sub type from the event sub type dropdown list.

## To add rules to your topic, click **Add a condition**.
{: #en-topic-condition}
